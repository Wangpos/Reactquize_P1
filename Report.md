Problem

The Eslint which is a code analysis tool finds out 2 problems in code files when it is being executed.

The problem was on the demo-todo-app.spec.ts file whre the type `any` is used, which is discouraged in the usage of code.

Specifically, the errors are at:

Line 429: In the function
`checkNumberOfCompletedTodosInLocalStorage`, the callback uses `(todo: any) => ....` You should replace any with a more precise type.
Line 435: In the function `checkTodosInLocalStorage`, the callback uses `(todo: any) => ....` Again, replace any with a more precise type.

Solution

To resolve this issue, replace the usage of the type `any` with a more specific type for todo objects. Hereâ€™s how i have done it:

Define a Todo type that matches the structure of your todo items (e.g., with title and completed properties).
Use this Todo type instead of any in your functions.

```typescript
type Todo = {
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
```

Then update the functions: 

```typescript
// ...existing code...
JSON.parse(localStorage['react-todos']).filter((todo: Todo) => todo.completed).length === e;
// ...existing code...
JSON.parse(localStorage['react-todos']).map((todo: Todo) => todo.title).includes(t);
// ...existing code...
```
